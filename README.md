## Repository for posterity

yamiPhoto was written quite a while ago, and by now is quite old. Repository recorded here for posterity. For those who wrote simple Perl CGI scripts when they were popular, enjoy the nostalgia.

## About

Yami means "pair" in Sanskrit.

yamiPhoto is a small set of Perl CGI scripts for uploading or deleting image files. After uploading an image file it will generate a thumbnail image file (the original and the thumbnail being the "pair").
